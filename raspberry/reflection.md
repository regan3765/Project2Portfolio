Reflection

### What I did well
Following a tutorial on how to make a notification and to send the data i need to the notification


### what I need to improve
Time management as this took longer than expected and should of asked a team member for help.
Need to work step by step as this may have helped me complete this challenge quicker. 

### Learning 
i should not have commit without the dd [here](https://github.com/SoftEnOP/op-stats-team-1/commit/1db84dee73629b3fe91df1aabf0f2f633439afcf) is the commit that removed that method.

I Also learned about modals and how to pass data from a button to a pop up modal.
How to make a notification's as this is how a user knows if they have a request to block some one or not and clicking on that notification takes you to a new page where you can complete the ban.


### Barriers 
Finding multiple tutorials to do the same job and they all had different ways of doing them.
