Reflection

### What I did well
I did ask another team member to check that my banning system was still working.
I also cam down pretty hard on a team member that

### what I need to improve
I need to improve on testing the software on the master before pushing it to the deployed server as or team did not check all the functionality even on our deployed system. Maybe we should of had a check list printed off and gone through each time we had pushed our product to our live website

### Learning 
To not rely on my team mates to check something that i had produced and to make sure for my self that my features that i have implemented to work on our master.

I was disappointed in myself for the software that i produced( banning and unbanning ) that i knew worked when i implemented it and somehow not working as well as not checking that it worked

### Barriers 
producing website that is not functional and that as a team we could of checked it together but i found that Mitchel did not contribute or check our deployed website.
