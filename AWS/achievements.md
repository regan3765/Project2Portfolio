When we were doing daily scrums/stand-up meetings I would cut the person short if they were going to in-depth with their problem or going off in a tangent.


Learning about branches as this is professional as we are all working on different parts of the project Which makes it easy

Ethan messaged me and said he had a bug. I looked at what he done, It was a simple fix but it took longer than it should of to fix. The command that would of helped me find the fault was php artisan route:list and that would have shown the routes and i would have seen that the problem was with the route and naming conventions so after i changed it, it worked as expected.
