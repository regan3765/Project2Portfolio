title: Sprint 1 Reflection
---

Reflection i had put the git in another folder instead of the root.

### What I did well
started strongly with making the project 

### what I need to improve
My commit messages need to be more or an explanation because there have merge issues as well as adding files and lines of code with no explanation.
My communication need to improve.
Instead of fixing the a members issue i should have told him about the issues and see if he would fix them or if he wanted me to fix them.

### Learning 
I've learned the basics of Laravel and implementing migrations to a database so that i can save data being saved to 

### Barriers 
Working on the master branch has been problematic as there have been lots of merge conflicts
