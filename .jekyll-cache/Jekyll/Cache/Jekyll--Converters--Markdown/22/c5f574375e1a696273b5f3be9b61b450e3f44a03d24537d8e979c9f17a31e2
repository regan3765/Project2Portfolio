I"Ž<p>This job was created by rob for us to look through and find out all the services that are running on our servers upstairs.</p>

<p>Scott and Jae went upstairs to have a look at the servers where we connected a monitor to see what was going on and to login. We then found that we could access it on the local ip addressâ€™s (10.118.27.140 and 10.118.27.141).</p>

<p>We then needed to get the password, which we got from Rob and also they might be located on Robâ€™s github account which we have access with itintern account, along with other passwords in there.</p>

<p>Scott then made up a spread sheet and then contacted the lectures to find out what servers are being used and need to be retained till they migration</p>

<p>I also knew that there were websites being hosted like the aviation insurance website which is a live website that should have been shifted else where, not on our development servers.</p>

<p>One service from the serve that we canâ€™t get access to is the vcsa.staging.op-bit.nz as this is part of the vsphere to manage the servers</p>
