I"W<p>So as part of the auditing and finding out what systems needs to be shut down and one of those system’s is gitlab that we host upstairs in D block which in our time here has become more and more of a nuisance and has not been used by the lecture’s for at least a year now and they are using teams and the github class rooms as it is more reliable and more easier to use.</p>

<p>so there was only one person that got back to me about needing something off it, so i logged on with the username and password from the key pass and that gave me admin access so i could see, and download everything that Grayson needed from the Mobile group and i zipped it up and sent it to him via teams message.</p>

<p>Rob came to me and asked me to look into something that a previous group had made for checkpoints for one of the lectures i messaged one of the ex students and i looked on gitlab for checkpointtools to start with and then they said something about smt which it looked like something they had mad for a start up company.</p>
