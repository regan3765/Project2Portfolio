I"ê<p>Hamish has assigned a task to the ops group to get images from a windows 7 pc‚Äôs for the ones they are giving away to varies people/groups/organizations</p>

<p>We originally got the document from Hamish that had instructions about how to deploy to the machines, but no documents on how to upload a new image.</p>

<p>The problem that we came across after updating the machines and trying to upload them was this :</p>

<p><img src="img/cloneDeploy/Problem1.png" alt="alt text" style="width: 450px" /></p>

<p>after we had updated windows7 we would try to upload the image to the server, the hard drive appears to have both GPT and MBR partitions.</p>

<p>so then we tried to install a new copy of windows, that didn‚Äôt work, then tried to delete everything on the disk with dban

<p>Which is an opensource linux data wiping tool. 
Then we tried installing windows again and updating then trying to upload it with the machine with the same problem.</p>

<p>Then I emailed our client Hamish. Who then came down and had a wee discussion with me and then we changed some of the BIOS settings then installed a windows again then we tested if it could upload and image with success then when we tried to update the windows to patch it we ran in to this error.
