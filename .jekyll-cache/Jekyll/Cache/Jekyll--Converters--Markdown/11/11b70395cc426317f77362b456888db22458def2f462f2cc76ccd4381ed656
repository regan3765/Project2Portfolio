I"4<p>Updating gitlab tho we aren’t using this for service for the BIT like we use to I thought it would be a good idea to update since it hadn’t been updated this year at all which is why i had to update gitlab a few times as the latest version couldn’t be updated directly I had to do it in stages.</p>
