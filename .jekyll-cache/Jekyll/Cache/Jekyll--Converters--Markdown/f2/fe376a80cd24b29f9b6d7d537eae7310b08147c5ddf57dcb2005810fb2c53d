I"¦<p>The CCL visit was amazing. To see the environment of this company based in Christchurch is awesome and locations all over New Zealand.</p>

<p>The Best thing that I got out of the visit was seeing what it was like to see the datacenter and how its set up and what i could expect to see in that environment, and what they have to offer from the datacenter to the cloud, and from looking after the customer and their needs to the security side of things. Seeing the NOC center that was cool and hearing her story that she started from the help desk and want to work in that area and she got there. So that was really motivating to here that she started low and where she is now.
It was good seeing the range of things the CCL provide to their customers the new innovative team thats going to be working is cool, even the sales people that have to try and sale things to the customers.</p>

<p>I could see my self working their.</p>
