I"O<p>So today i was in DB3 when Krissi our lecture told all of us of a problem that the class had as it is part of our 10% lab.</p>

<p>The problem was that all of our containers(1 for each student in the class) and that the sql agent in the container which is a Microsoft sql server and to complete the task we needed to be able to create and schedule schedule a job like backing up a database but by default the sql agent is disabled by default and the fix was to run this command</p>

<p>EXEC sp_configure ‘show advanced options’, 1
GO
RECONFIGURE
GO
EXEC sp_configure ‘Agent XPs’</p>

<p>GO
EXEC SP_CONFIGURE ‘Agent XPs’,1
GO
RECONFIGURE
GO</p>

<p>and then Refresh the connection or the sql agent and then you could create and schedule a job</p>

<p>Krissi said that she had tried this before and it didn’t work but I’m not sure if she refreshed it like i did.</p>

<p><img src="img/DB3Problem/codeMessage.png" alt="alt text" style="width:700px" />
so I showed her what id done sent her the code and she tried it and then refreshed and it worked</p>
