description: Deploying the Help Site

The Web08 server is located in F Block and is a production server running windows server 2016. <br>I Had to install a package manager because the help site deploys from hugo, there are other ways we could upload this site to the web, but this is what it uses.


![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy2.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy3.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy4.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy9.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy10.png){: style="width: 800px"} 

So on this server i had to install git and Hugo and to install hugo you need to install chocolaty a windows package manager, for the help site to be served

![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy6.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
This is the helpsite being running locally through hugo to make sure that it works 
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy7.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
setting up the server to ip address and pot number
![alt-image]( img/helpsite/deploy8.png){: style="width: 800px"} 
Shows the support site help.ict.op.ac.nz on the ip address
