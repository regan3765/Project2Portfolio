Updating gitlab tho we aren't using this for service for the BIT like we use to I thought it would be a good idea to update since it hadn't been updated this year at all which is why i had to update gitlab a few times as the latest version couldn't be updated directly I had to do it in stages.

Gitlab-runner errors this is why i decided to update the system

I am on the  gitlab server and I'm also looking at GitLab docker Images

I found this to be able to do my upgrades in stages and i stuck to it to be able to do the updates.

updating gitlab using 'docker-compose pull' and then 'docker-compose up -d' which i had to do a few times changing the image each time to a newer one
