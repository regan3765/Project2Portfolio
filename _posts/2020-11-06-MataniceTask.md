This is checking the lab computers in D312 where first years have to do maintenance on PC like installing cpu's, memory, power supplies, installing operating systems.

So what we do up there is we check to see if they boot if they boot there is no problem with the hardware, we record it on the books attached to the machine, wether it boots properly and if it shuts down cleanly. 
Any issues that we have we record what they are, if we can fix them, like reinstalling a cpu, check all the things that could be wrong with it, then if we cant figure it out we will tell rob that x isn't working what we have tried to fix the problem and then go from there.
Rob may order new parts and at a latter date we will install what needs to be installed checked that it works and record what we have done.

Scott and me have installed new mother boards to 2 machines with new cpu's and then we set it up, made sure that run correctly and i need a video card for my motherboard so we could see anything on a screen.
