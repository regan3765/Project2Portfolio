description: Getting files for Grayson's Project Teams Mobile app

So as part of the auditing and finding out what systems needs to be shut down and one of those system's is gitlab that we host upstairs in D block which in our time here has become more and more of a nuisance and has not been used by the lecture's for at least a year now and they are using teams and the github class rooms as it is more reliable and more easier to use.

so there was only one person that got back to me about needing something off it, so i logged on with the username and password from the key pass and that gave me admin access so i could see, and download everything that Grayson needed from the Mobile group and i zipped it up and sent it to him via teams message.

Rob came to me and asked me to look into something that a previous group had made for checkpoints for one of the lectures i messaged one of the ex students and i looked on gitlab for checkpointtools to start with and then they said something about smt which it looked like something they had mad for a start up company. So that didn't end being what she was after.
