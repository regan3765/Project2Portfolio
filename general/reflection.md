Reflection

### What I did well
Talking to team mates and working together on Discord while we talk to discuss and help each other fix bugs and motivate one anther and working together where we can quickly look at what they have done and the errors they have to help them fix them as well as them doing the same.

### what I need to improve
Knowing when to make a new migration file to change anything inside the database, and probably left the merging of the listing scores branch to the team members that were working on it.

### Learning 

I should have made another migration changing the primary key to big increments as i had just changed the migration files already there and then when my team mate deployed and run the migration he was getting migration problem, and he then when an refreshed or fresh the command to make the migration files work this worked but we then lost all our data from our users.


### Barriers 

Migration issues was a barrier as we could not migrate or even migrate fresh
